### All-Points Bulletin

I need your help. We need to find a newer version of the source code for
this driver, if Realtek still supports Linux on this chipset. It is
unfortunate that Realtek does such a poor job of making the source code
for their drivers available but that is the way it is. I recommend
Mediatek based USB WiFi adapters because Mediatek does a MUCH better job
of supporting Linux users. However, there are still many of us that have
and use adapters based on the rtl8814au chipset so I will try to
maintain this driver as long as it is practical to do so. What we really
need is a new modernized version of this driver as it has become hard to
maintain and it is missing many modern features. As much as I have
searched, I have not been able to locate a newer version. This driver is
v5.8.5.1 dated 20191029. If we can find a new driver for the 8814au that
is up to date, we can make better use of our 8814au adapters. A newer
driver should have version numbers of 5.12.x, 5.13.x or higher. Please
search all locations that might have a new version available. Ask 
retailers. Please help.

support and keep it current. I reserve the right to delete this support
if it causes any problems.

Note: Android is supported in the driver according to Realtek. I will
support knowledgable Android developers if they want to merge and keep
current the required support (most likely just instructions about how to
compile and make a modification or two to the Makefile).

### Installation Information

Warning: Installing multiple out-of-kernel drivers for the same hardware
usually does not end well. The install-driver.sh script has the capability
to detect and remove many conflicting drivers but not all. If this driver
does not work well after installation and you have previously installed a
driver that you did not remove, it is suggested that you run the following
command in an effort to determine if you need to take action to manually
remove conflicting drivers:

```
sudo dkms status
```

Warning: If you decide to do a distro upgrade, which will likely install a
new version of kernel such as 5.15 to 6.1, you need to upgrade this driver
with the newest available code before performing the disto upgrade. Use
the following commands in the driver directory:

```
git pull
```

```
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

Temporary internet access is required for installation. There are numerous ways
to enable temporary internet access depending on your hardware and situation.
[One method is to use tethering from a phone.](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-tether-your-smartphone-in-linux).
Another method is to keep a [WiFi adapter that uses an in-kernel driver](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/USB_WiFi_Adapters_that_are_supported_with_Linux_in-kernel_drivers.md) in your toolkit.

You will need to use the terminal interface. The quick way to open a terminal:
Ctrl+Alt+T (hold down on the Ctrl and Alt keys then press the T key).

An alternative terminal is to use SSH (Secure Shell) from the same or from
another computer, in which case you will be in a suitable terminal after logging
in, but this step requires that an SSH daemon/server has already been
configured. (There are lots of SSH guides available, e.g., for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#setting-up-an-ssh-server) and for [Ubuntu](https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-ssh-server). Do not forget [to secure the SSH server](https://www.howtogeek.com/443156/the-best-ways-to-secure-your-ssh-server/).)

You will need to have sufficient access rights to use `sudo` so that commands
can be executed as the `root` user. (If the command `sudo echo Yes` returns
"Yes", with or without having to enter your password, you do have sufficient
access rights.)

DKMS is used for the installation, if available. DKMS is a system utility
which will automatically recompile and reinstall this driver when a new
kernel is installed. DKMS is provided by and maintained by Dell.

It is recommended that you do not delete the driver directory after
installation as the directory contains information and scripts that you
may need in the future.

Secure Boot: see FAQ.

### Installation Steps

Note: The installation instructions are for the novice user. Experienced users are
welcome to alter the installation to meet their needs. Support will be provided,
on a best effort basis, based on the steps below.

#### Step 1: Open a terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+T)

#### Step 2: Update and upgrade system packages (select the option for the distro you are using)

Note: If your Linux distro does not fall into one of options listed
below, you will need to research how to `update` and `upgrade` your system
packages.

- Option for Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, Kali, Armbian and Raspberry Pi OS

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

- Option for Arch based distributions such as Manjaro

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

- Option for Fedora based distributions

```
sudo dnf upgrade
```

- Option for openSUSE based distributions

```
sudo zypper update
```

- Option for Void Linux

```
sudo xbps-install -Syu
```

Note: It is recommended that you reboot your system at this point. The
rest of the installation will appreciate having a fully up-to-date
system to work with. The installation can then be continued with Step 3.

```
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 3: Install the required packages (select the option for the distro you are using)

Note: If your Linux distro does not fall into one of options listed
below, you will need to research how to properly setup up the development
environment for your system. General guidance follows.

Development Environment Requirements: (package names may vary by distro)

- Mandatory packages: `gcc` `make` `bc` `kernel-headers` `build-essential` `git`
- Highly recommended packages: `dkms` `rfkill` `iw` `ip`
- Mandatory packages if Secure Boot is active: `openssl` `sign-file` `mokutil`

Note: The below options should take care of the mandatory and highly recommended
requirements. If Secure Boot is active on your system, please also install the
mandatory packages for Secure Boot as shown above.

- Option for Armbian (arm64)

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

- Option for Raspberry Pi OS (arm/arm64)

```
sudo apt install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers build-essential bc dkms git
```

- Option for Debian, Kali, and Raspberry Pi Desktop (x86)

```
sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential bc dkms git libelf-dev rfkill iw
```

- Option for Ubuntu (all official flavors) and the numerous Ubuntu based distros

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git iw
```

- Option for Fedora

```
sudo dnf -y install git dkms kernel-devel
```

- Option for openSUSE

```
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_kernel dkms
```

- Option for Alpine

```
sudo apk add linux-lts-dev make gcc
```

- Option for Void Linux

```
sudo xbps-install linux-headers dkms git make
```

- Options for Arch and Manjaro (if using Manjaro for RasPi4B, see note)

If using pacman

```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm linux-headers dkms git bc iw
```

Note: The following is needed if using Manjaro for RasPi4B.

```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm linux-rpi4-headers dkms git bc
```

Note: If you are asked to choose a provider, make sure to choose the one
that corresponds to your version of the linux kernel (for example,
"linux510-headers" for Linux kernel version 5.10). If you install the
incorrect version, you'll have to uninstall it and install the correct
version.

If using other methods, please follow the instructions provided by those
methods.

#### Step 4: Create a directory to hold the downloaded driver

```
mkdir -p ~/src
```

#### Step 5: Move to the newly created directory

```
cd ~/src
```

#### Step 6: Download the driver

```
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/8814au.git
```

#### Step 7: Move to the newly created driver directory

```
cd ~/src/8814au
```

#### Step 8: Run the installation script (`install-driver.sh`)

Note: It is recommended that you terminate running apps so as to provide the
maximum amount of RAM to the compilation process.

Note: For automated builds (non-interactive), use `NoPrompt` as an option.

```
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

or

```
sudo sh install-driver.sh
```

Note: If you elect to skip the reboot at the end of the installation
script, the driver may not load immediately and the driver options will
not be applied. Rebooting is strongly recommended.

Note: Fedora users that have secure boot turned on may need to run the
following to enroll the key:

```
sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub
```

### Manual Installation Instructions

Note: The above installation steps automate the installation process,
however, if you want to or need to do a basic command line installation,
use the following:

```
make clean
```

```
make
```

If secure boot is off:

```
sudo make install
```

```
sudo reboot
```

If secure boot is on:

Note: Please read to the end of this section before coming back here to
enter commands.

```
sudo make sign-install
```

You will be promted for a password, please remember the password as it
will be used in some of the following steps.

```
sudo reboot
```

The MOK managerment screen will appear during boot:

`Shim UEFI Key Management"

`Press any key...`

Select "Enroll key"

Select "Continue"

Select "Yes"

When promted, enter the password you entered earlier.

If you enter the wrong password, your computer will not be bootable. In
this case, use the BOOT menu from your BIOS to boot then as follows:

```
sudo mokutil --reset
```

Restart your computer and use the BOOT menu from BIOS to boot. In the MOK
managerment screen, select `reset MOK list`. Then Reboot and retry from
the step `sudo make sign-install`.

To remove the driver if installed by the manual installation instructions:

```
sudo make uninstall
```

```
sudo reboot
```

Note: If you use the manual installation instructions, you will need to
repeat the process each time a new kernel is installed in your distro.

-----

### Driver Options (`edit-options.sh`)

A file called `8814au.conf` will be installed in `/etc/modprobe.d` by
default if you use the `install-driver.sh` script.

Note: The installation script will prompt you to edit the options.

Location: `/etc/modprobe.d/8814au.conf`

This file will be read and applied to the driver on each system boot.

To edit the driver options file, run the `edit-options.sh` script

```
sudo ./edit-options.sh
```

Note: Documentation for Driver Options is included in the file `8814au.conf`.

-----

### Upgrading the Driver

Note: Linux development is continuous therefore work on this driver is continuous.

Note: Upgrading the driver is advised in the following situations:

- if a new or updated version of the driver needs to be installed
- if a distro version upgrade is going to be installed (i.e. going from kernel 5.10 to kernel 5.15)

#### Step 1: Move to the driver directory

```
cd ~/src/8814au
```

#### Step 2: Remove the currently installed driver

```
sudo ./remove-driver.sh
```

#### Step 3: Pull updated code from this repo

```
git pull
```

#### Step 4: Install the driver

```
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

-----
### Removal of the Driver (`remove-driver.sh`)

Note: Removing the driver is advised in the following situations:

- if driver installation fails
- if the driver is no longer needed

Note: The following removes everything that has been installed, with the
exception of the packages installed in Step 3 and the driver directory.
The driver directory can be deleted after running this script.

#### Step 1: Open a terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+T)

#### Step 2: Move to the driver directory

```
cd ~/src/8814au
```

#### Step 3: Run the removal script

Note: For automated builds (non-interactive), use `NoPrompt` as an option.

```
sudo ./remove-driver.sh
```

### Recommended WiFi Router/ Access Point Settings

Note: These are general recommendations, some of which may not apply to your specific situation.

- Security: Set WPA2-AES or WPA2/WPA3 mixed or WPA3. Do not set WPA2 mixed mode or WPA or TKIP.

- Channel width for 2.4 GHz: Set 20 MHz fixed width. Do not use 40 MHz or 20/40 automatic.

- Channels for 2.4 GHz: Set channel 1 or 6 or 11 depending on the congestion at your location. Do not set automatic channel selection. As time passes, if you notice poor performance, recheck congestion and set channel appropriately. The environment around you can and does change over time.

- Mode for 2.4 GHz: For best performance, set "N only" if you no longer use B or G capable devices.

- Network names: Do not set the 2.4 GHz Network and the 5 GHz Network to the same name. Note: Unfortunately many routers come with both networks set to the same name. You need to be able to control which network that is in use so changing the name of one of the networks is recommended. Since many IoT devices use the 2.4 GHz network, it may be better to change the name of the 5 GHz network.

- Channels for 5 GHz: Not all devices are capable of using DFS channels (I'm looking at you Roku.) It may be necessary to set a fixed channel in the range of 36 to 48 or 149 to 165 in order for all of your devices to work on 5 GHz. (For US, other countries may vary.)

- Best location for the WiFi router/access point: Near center of apartment or house, at least a couple of feet away from walls, in an elevated location. You may have to test to see what the best location is in your environment.

- Check congestion: There are apps available for smart phones that allow you to get an idea of the congestion levels on WiFi channels. The apps generally go by the name of `WiFi Analyzer` or something similar.

After making and saving changes, reboot the router.

### Recommendations regarding USB

- Moving your USB WiFi adapter to a different USB port has been known to fix a variety of problems.

- If connecting your USB WiFi adapter to a desktop computer, use the USB ports on the rear of the computer. Why? The ports on the rear are directly connected to the motherboard which will reduce problems with interference and disconnection.

- If your USB WiFi adapter is USB 3 capable and you want it to operate in USB3 mode, plug it into a USB 3 port.

- Avoid USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports if possible as almost all currently available adapters have been tested with USB 3.1 Gen 1 (aka USB 3) and not with USB 3.1 Gen 2.

- If you use an extension cable and your adapter is USB 3 capable, the cable needs to be USB 3 capable (if not, you will be limited to USB 2 speeds).

- Extention cables can be problematic. A way to check if the extension cable is the problem is to plug the adapter temporarily into a USB port on the computer.

- Some USB WiFi adapters require considerable electrical current and push the capabilities of the power available via USB port. One example is adapters that use the Realtek 8814au chipset. Using a powered multiport USB extension can be a good idea in cases like this.
