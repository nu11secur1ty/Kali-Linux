## Updating Kali

When should you update Kali?
If you have a default installation of Kali, you should be checking for updates every few weeks. If you need a new version of a tool, or hear about a security update, that may speed up the timetable. However, a good practice is that you ensure all tools work before an engagement and during that engagement you should not update. As Kali is a rolling release, once in a while issues will sneak into rolling and may break a tool that is needed.

If you are using last-snapshot, you will not receive updates until we release the next version of Kali for that year. For this reason, it is a good idea to follow the Kali Twitter, or check the Kali website every few months. Kali has a release four times a year, and follows a loose quarterly schedule.
